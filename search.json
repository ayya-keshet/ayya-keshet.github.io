    "text": "[paper] [code]\nMulti-state survival data are common, and can be used to describe trajectories in diverse applications such as a patient’s health progression through disease states, pickups during the workday of a taxi driver, or a website browsing trajectory to name a few. When faced with such data, a researcher or clinician might seek to characterize the possible transitions between states, their occurrence probabilities, or to predict the trajectory of future observations given various baseline and time-varying individual covariates (features). By fitting a multi-state model, we can learn the hazard for each specific transition, which would later be used to predict future paths. Predicting paths can be used at a single individual level, for example predicting how long a cancer patient will be relapse-free given his current health status, or at what probability will a patient end a trajectory at any of the possible states. At the population level paths predictions can be used, for example, to estimate how many patients which arrive at the emergency-room will need to be admitted, given their covariates. Moreover, their expected hospitalization duration can also be inferred, and provide planners with anticipated patients load."

    "section": "",
    "text": "[preprint]\nThe vast and rapid spread of COVID-19 calls for immediate action from policy-makers, and indeed various lockdown measures were implemented in many countries. Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyze the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and Ageusia. A total of 1,456,461 survey responses were analyzed. We defined a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Average (SA), as the mean number of symptoms reported by responders. Data were collected between March 15th to May 11th, 2020. Notably, following severe lockdown measures, we found that between March 15th and April 20th, SA sharply declined by 83.8%, as did every individual symptom, including the most common symptoms reported by our responders, cough and rhinorrhea andnasal congestion, which decreased by 74.1% and 69.6%, respectively. Individual symptoms exhibit differences in reduction dynamics, suggesting differences in the medical conditions that they represent or in the nature of the symptoms themselves. The reduction in symptoms was observed in all the cities in Israel, and in several stratifications of demographic characteristics. Between April 20th and May 11th, following several subsequent lockdown relief measures, the decrease in SA and individual symptoms halted and they remain relatively stable with no significant change. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This quantification may be of major interest for COVID-19 pandemic, as many countries consider implementation of lockdown strategies."

    "text": "[paper]\nPlasma fasting glucose (FG) levels play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes worldwide. Here we investigated FG values using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices in nondiabetic adults aged 40–70 years. FG was measured during 59,565 morning windows of 8,315 individuals (7.16 ± 3.17 days per participant). Mean FG was 96.2 ± 12.87 mg dl−1, rising by 0.234 mg dl−1 per year with age. Intraperson, day-to-day variability expressed as FG standard deviation was 7.52 ± 4.31 mg dl−1. As there are currently no CGM-based criteria for diabetes diagnosis, we analyzed the potential implications of this variability on the classification of glycemic status based on current plasma FG-based diagnostic guidelines. Among 5,328 individuals who would have been considered to have normal FG based on the first FG measurement, 40% and 3% would have been reclassified as having glucose in the prediabetes and diabetes ranges, respectively, based on sequential measurements throughout the study. Finally, we revealed associations between mean FG and various clinical measures. Our findings suggest that careful consideration is necessary when interpreting FG as substantial intraperson variability exists and highlight the potential impact of using CGM data to refine glycemic status assessment."

    "text": "[paper]\nGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) associate phenotypes and genetic variants across a study cohort. GWASs require large-scale cohorts with both phenotype and genetic sequencing data, limiting studied phenotypes. The Human Phenotype Project is a longitudinal study that has measured a wide range of clinical and biomolecular features from a self-assignment cohort over 5 years. The phenotypes collected are quantitative traits, providing higher-resolution insights into the genetics of complex phenotypes.\nWe present the results of GWASs and polygenic risk score phenome-wide association studies with 729 clinical phenotypes and 4,043 molecular features from the Human Phenotype Project. This includes clinical traits that have not been previously associated with genetics, including measures from continuous sleep monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring, liver ultrasound, hormonal status, and fundus imaging.\nIn GWAS of 8,706 individuals, we found significant associations between 169 clinical traits and 1,184 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found genes associated with both glycemic control and mental disorders, and we quantify the strength of genetic signals in serum metabolites. In polygenic risk score phenome-wide association studies for clinical traits, we found 16,047 significant associations.\nThe entire set of findings, which we disseminate publicly, provides newfound resolution into the genetic architecture of complex human phenotypes."

Technological advances in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices introduce a potential tool to expand our understanding of glucose control and variability in people with and without diabetes.

Here we present CGMap, a characterization of CGM data collected from over 7,000 non-diabetic individuals, aged 40-70 years, between 2019 and 2022. We provide reference values of key CGM-derived clinical measures that can serve as a tool for future CGM research. We further explored the relationship between CGM-derived measures and diabetes-related clinical parameters, uncovering several significant relationships, including associations of mean blood glucose with measures from fundus imaging and sleep monitoring. These findings offer novel research directions for understanding the influence of glucose levels on various aspects of human health."

    "text": "[paper]\nThe gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is detection of viral RNA through PCR. Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential.\nWe devised a model estimating the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions that have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel in its first 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive.\nOur model was validated on a held-out set of individuals from Israel where it achieved an auROC of 0.737 (CI: 0.712–0.759) and auPR of 0.144 (CI: 0.119–0.177) and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel in an independently collected symptom survey dataset from the US, UK, and Sweden. Our analyses revealed interactions between several symptoms and age, suggesting variation in the clinical manifestation of the disease in different age groups.\nOur tool can be used online and without exposure to suspected patients, thus suggesting worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified. Moreover, individuals at high risk for a positive test result can be isolated prior to testing."

We used clinically validated instruments to assess anxiety- and depression-related emotional distress, symptoms, and coping strategies, as well as questions designed to specifically assess COVID-19-related concerns. Higher emotional burden was associated with being female, younger, unemployed, living in high socioeconomic status localities, having prior medical conditions, encountering more people, and experiencing physiological symptoms. Our findings highlight the environmental context and its importance in understanding individual ability to cope with the long-term stressful challenges of the pandemic."

    "text": "[paper]\nThis study introduces a novel, rich dataset obtained from home sleep apnea tests using the FDA-approved WatchPAT-300 device, collected from 7,077 participants over 21,412 nights. The dataset comprises three levels of sleep data: raw multi-channel time-series from sensors, annotated sleep events, and computed summary statistics, which include 447 features related to sleep architecture, sleep apnea, and heart rate variability (HRV). We present reference values for Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), sleep efficiency, Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), and HRV sample entropy, stratified by age and sex. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dataset improves the predictive capability for various health related traits, including body composition, bone density, blood sugar levels and cardiovascular health. These results illustrate the dataset’s potential to advance sleep research, personalized healthcare, and machine learning applications in biomedicine."

    "text": "[paper]\nCardiometabolic diseases are a major public-health concern owing to their increasing prevalence worldwide. These diseases are characterized by a high degree of interindividual variability with regards to symptoms, severity, complications and treatment responsiveness. Recent technological advances, and the growing availability of wearable and digital devices, are now making it feasible to profile individuals in ever-increasing depth. Such technologies are able to profile multiple health-related outcomes, including molecular, clinical and lifestyle changes. Nowadays, wearable devices allowing for continuous and longitudinal health screening outside the clinic can be used to monitor health and metabolic status from healthy individuals to patients at different stages of disease. Here we present an overview of the wearable and digital devices that are most relevant for cardiometabolic-disease-related readouts, and how the information collected from such devices could help deepen our understanding of metabolic diseases, improve their diagnosis, identify early disease markers and contribute to individualization of treatment and prevention plans."

    "text": "[paper] [blog]\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, obtaining information on symptoms dynamics is of essence. Here, we extracted data from primary-care electronic health records and nationwide distributed surveys to assess the longitudinal dynamics of symptoms prior to and throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information was available for 206,377 individuals, including 2471 positive cases. The two datasources were discordant, with survey data capturing most of the symptoms more sensitively. The most prevalent symptoms included fever, cough and fatigue. Loss of taste and smell 3 weeks prior to testing, either self-reported or recorded by physicians, were the most discriminative symptoms for COVID-19. Additional discriminative symptoms included self-reported headache and fatigue and a documentation of syncope, rhinorrhea and fever. Children had a significantly shorter disease duration. Several symptoms were reported weeks after recovery. By a unique integration of two datasources, our study shed light on the longitudinal course of symptoms experienced by cases in primary care."

    "text": "[paper]\nCoronavirus infection spreads in clusters, and early identification of these clusters is critical for slowing down the spread of the virus. Here we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters and informing epidemiologists, public-health officials and policymakers. We show preliminary results from an Israeli survey of a cumulative number of over 74,000 responses and call for additional countries to join an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data will allow the following: faster detection of spreading zones and patients; acquisition of a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; prediction of future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; and evaluation of the effectiveness of the various social-distancing measures taken and their contribution to reducing the number of symptomatic people. This information could provide a valuable tool for decision-makers in those areas in which strengthening of social-distancing measures is needed and those in which such measures can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with a confirmed patient history of COVID-19, more people report experiencing COVID-19-associated symptoms, which demonstrates the potential utility of our approach for the detection of outbreaks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "[paper] [code]\nAssessing the impact of cesarean delivery (CD) on long-term childhood outcomes is challenging as conducting a randomized controlled trial is rarely feasible and inferring it from observational data may be confounded. Utilizing data from electronic health records of 737,904 births, we defined and emulated a target trial to estimate the effect of CD on predefined long-term pediatric outcomes. Causal effects were estimated using pooled logistic regression and standardized survival curves, leveraging data breadth to account for potential confounders. Diverse sensitivity analyses were performed including replication of results in an external validation set from the UK including 625,044 births. Children born in CD had an increased risk to develop asthma (10-year risk differences (95% CI) 0.64% (0.31, 0.98)), an average treatment effect of 0.10 (0.07–0.12) on body mass index (BMI) z-scores at age 5 years old and 0.92 (0.68–1.14) on the number of respiratory infection events until 5 years of age. A positive 10-year risk difference was also observed for atopy (10-year risk differences (95% CI) 0.74% (-0.06, 1.52)) and allergy 0.47% (-0.32, 1.28)). Increased risk for these outcomes was also observed in the UK cohort. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence on the long-term effects of CD on pediatric morbidity, may assist in the decision to perform CD when not medically indicated and paves the way to future research on the mechanisms underlying these effects and intervention strategies targeting them."
